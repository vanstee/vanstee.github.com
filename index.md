Hi, I'm Patrick.

I'm currently writing software at [Operable](https://operable.io) from Atlanta,
GA. Previously at [Assembly](http://assemblymade.com) and
[Big Nerd Ranch](https://www.bignerdranch.com).

Whether it's writing software, wireframing, or talking to users, **I've always
focused on product.** Here's what I'd look for in my ideal position:

* **Given significant control over product direction**
* On a team of happy developers with strong engineering practices
* Working on an open source product or developer tool

I definitely have opinions about programming languages and choice of tools, but
it has always been more important for me to work on a product that has users
who care about it.

But, career stuff aside, here's what I do in my free time:

* Study and build distributed systems and data structures
* Read about human factors, UX, and UI design
* Build electronics (synthesizers, mechanical keyboards)
* Brew and drink unhealthy amounts of fancy coffee

If you're looking for help with your product, want to hear how great it is to
live in Atlanta, or just want to reach out,
[shoot me an email](mailto:patrick@vanstee.me?subject=Hai).
