Hi, I'm Patrick.

I'm currently writing software at [Operable](https://operable.io) from Atlanta,
GA. Previously at [Assembly](http://assemblymade.com) and
[Big Nerd Ranch](https://www.bignerdranch.com).

I've been writing software for over 10 years. Most of that time has been spent
building web applications, working with distributed systems, and thinking about
product direction. But, in general, I love solving hard and unique problems,
learning about how everything works throughout the entire stack, and, even more
so, seeing how systems fail.

The sweet spot between my interests and experience would be working on the
backend of a product or supporting infrastructure, with the resources to
research and solve complex problems, on a team of happy developers with an
engineering culture that promotes high-quality, maintainable code.

But, career stuff aside, here's what I do in my free time:

* Study and build distributed systems and data structures
* Read about human factors, UX, and UI design
* Build electronics (synthesizers, mechanical keyboards)
* Brew and drink unhealthy amounts of fancy coffee

Feel free to [shoot me an email](mailto:patrick@vanstee.me?subject=Hai) for any
reason.
