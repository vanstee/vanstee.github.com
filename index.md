Hi, I'm Patrick.

I'm currently writing software at [Salesforce](https://salesforce.com) from
Atlanta, GA. Previously at [Operable](https://operable.io),
[Assembly](http://assemblymade.com), and
[Big Nerd Ranch](https://www.bignerdranch.com).

I've been writing software for over 14 years. Most of that time has been spent
building web applications, working with distributed systems, managing
infrastructure, and thinking about product direction. But, in general, I love
solving hard and unique problems, learning about how everything works
throughout the entire stack, and, even more so, seeing how systems fail.

The sweet spot between my interests and experience would be working on the
backend or infrastructure side of a product as part of a team of happy
developers with an engineering culture that promotes high-quality, maintainable
code. Better yet, providing product direction and system design for technical,
developer-focused products would be an ideal fit.
