# Focus

Whether it's writing software, wireframing, or talking to users, **I've always
focused on product.** Here's what I'd look for in my ideal position:

* **Given significant control over product direction**
* On a team of happy developers with strong engineering practices
* Working on an open source product or developer tool

I definitely have opinions about programming languages and choice of tools, but
it has always been more important for me to work on a product that has users
who care about it.

The sweet spot between my interests and experience is when I have the autonomy
to push forward to build what customers want, with an engineering culture that
promotes high-quality, mantainable code, while still tackling complex problems,
both business and engineering related.

But, I also have my programming hobby interests. I've always loved reading
about distributed computing, things like Raft, MapReduce, WebRTC,
Erlang/Elixir, and CRDTs. Also, I really enjoy building software for
developers, not only because it's nice to build a product when you're one of
the users, but it also typically involves more interesting low-level problems
to learn about and solve.
